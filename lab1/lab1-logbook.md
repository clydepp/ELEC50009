> Technology Map (post mapping)

The compilation report states that there are 8 logic elements and 11 total pins being used.
It can be seen in the post mapping Technology map that there are four input pins, denoted by *SW[n]~input*, and seven output pins, denoted by *HEX0[m]~output*.
The report's eight logic elements relates to the decoder *Decoder0* and the OR gates *WideOrN*.
